## Design a culture probe related to your project


In one of the previous posts, we read a paper and talked about designing cultural probes. A key thing to keep in mind is how to design these cultural kits, as the designers must pick materials and activities that are relevant to their goals. 

For our project, the professors, instructors or TAs are the users. Me and my project partner think that these are the cultural probes which could be helpful:

-Diary

They can keep notes here regarding their teaching experience. What were the main issues they faced while teaching on a particular day? What techniques did they use to visualize data on their presentation? How much time in average did they spend drawing stuff on the board?

-SketchBook

Our project is directly related to sketching experience. The professor or instructor can record the sketches they plan to use in their class. 

-Camera or some photo sharing app

They can use their own phone camera to take a picture of the things they're teaching. And share it via some photo sharing app.
