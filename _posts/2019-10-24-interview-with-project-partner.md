## Interviewed by Project Partner

Task: Interview your partner about an activity they do (or be interviewed)

Our project is focused on creating an interactive whiteboard for Professors and TAs of various class especially the one that involves lots of visualizations. I am a TA for a lower division course in the CS department and I was interviewed by my project partner Archana Anand.


Archana: Hi Shipra, First of all, thank you for taking out the time to interview with me.
Me: It is my pleasure to help you out.

Archana: Let us get started with the interview.

Archana: Could you please tell me what do you teach here?

Me: I teach CSCI 1300 to undergrads in the department of Computer Science at CU Boulder.

Archana: I see, how many lectures do you take per week?

Me: Its held twice a week, and they’re each of 50 minutes duration.

Archana: How much time on average do you spend on preparing each recitation?

Me: Depends on the material. Some lectures are very equation and graph-heavy. It takes a while to add pictures/animations to the slides, and I also need to prepare notes/examples which I can show to the students. So, I’d put that at around 2-3 hours per recitation.

Archana: How do you usually go about showing some visual component of your lecture e.g a plot of an equation?

Me: I try to have a lot of examples on my slides. So, generally, I’d just add an image and show it to the students. If that leads to a discussion, I move to the whiteboard and start drawing more plots to explain the topic further. 

Archana: How frequently do you have to switch between drawing something on the whiteboard and teaching something from your slides directly?

Me: Not too frequently but when I have to do that, it is a bit of hassle.

Archana: What are some of the things in your lectures that require a lot of writing/drawing on the whiteboard/blackboard?

Me: When I am trying to visualize data in the memory and how is it accessed in a lower-level programming language.

Archana: What are some of the struggles you face while teaching such a course? Do you think there could be a better way to help you teach these concepts and get the point across?

Me: Yes, I wish I did not have to deal with writing with markers and erasing the whole whiteboard.

Archana: Have you used online/software tools to aid with this component of the lecture?

Me: None except powerpoint.

Archana: What are some of those tools which you found really useful, and why?

Me: It is easy to animate in powerpoint.

Archana: How do you retain these extra notes which you make in class?

Me: I sometimes have to click the picture of the whiteboard.

Archana: What are your thoughts on having a more interactive way to teach such concepts to our students?

Me: It would be amazing. Freshmen struggle a lot to visualize code like that of recursion.
