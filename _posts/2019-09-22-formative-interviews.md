## Reading Assignment 4: Formative Interviews

I chose to read these two articles for this assignment:
[Interview and Focus Group chapter](http://www.sciencedirect.com.colorado.idm.oclc.org/science/book/9780128053904)
[How Teens with Visual Impairments Take, Edit, and Share Photos on Social Media (Links to an external site.)](https://dl-acm-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/citation.cfm?id=3173650)
[Freedom to roam: a study of mobile device adoption and accessibility for people with visual and motor disabilities
 (Links to an external site.)](https://dl-acm-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/citation.cfm?id=1639663)

"Just as with so many other topics in computing, garbage in leads to garbage out.”

In the book by Lazar et al, the authors makes some compelling arguments for how you should be interviewing people, while gathering data for your system. One approach is to go deep but not broad. Surveys might miss useful data and perspectives, which can be gained from direct conversation with people instead. What you ask, how you ask, and how you ask it are the key things here. 

Another approach is forming focus groups, which is more challenging but can very valuable if organized properly. It lets you hear from many people at once, but possibly at less depth than you’d get by interviewing just one person. And we need to keep an eye out for detail, else we might miss the most important feedback. 

Nonetheless, both these strategies come with their own challenges. One biggest challenge is that they are both time consuming. Also, writing questions, identifying the appropriate responses, analyzing the data requires skill and patience. 

Moving on the second article, it discusses how teens with visual impairments access and use smart phone to take, edit and share photos on social media. It is interesting to note that they have developed strategies to around photo capturing, editing and sharing which aim to limit the limitations they otherwise face. Not only that, there is a common misconception that visually impaired people are not interested in photography. But these people have actually blogged their experiences and also put up tutorials online. The paper describes the methods in which the VIPs engage with photo-centric social media and what kind of workaround they’ve come up with. Some participants made editing decisions that helped them to see the photo better. The most common types of photos captured by VIP teens were functional photos. They’d quickly capture a photo of something they could not see in their environment, view its contents, and immediately delete it. For instance, one participant uses Snapchat camera to take a photo of the traffic signal, check if its green by zooming in, and delete it instantly. I think that is really smart!
The authors also come up with design recommendations which will improve the experience of VIPs. 

In the third article, it discusses how people with visual and motor disabilities use mobile devices in their daily routine. Although the accessibility problems of mobile devices are known, less is known about how people with disabilities choose mobile devices, adapt them to their needs, and use them in their everyday lives outside the home. The study and information gathering was done through a combination of interview and diary study. 
Participants used a variety of strategies to overcome mobile device problems, including memorizing device functions, customizing their devices, and using multiple devices in to overcome the limitations of a single device. For instance, one visually impaired participant carries with her a signature stamp, water-level sensor, CCTV magnifier, and her mobile phone.
This study calls the need to improve the overall accessibility of mobile devices, improving configurability in existing devices, contextual adaptation and integrating assistive devices.
