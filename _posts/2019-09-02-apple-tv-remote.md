**Design charrette on the Apple TV Remote**

Problem Statement: 

Which way is up on the Apple TV remote? The most popular complaints are that it is too good looking to be usable. Meaning it is too symmetrical and one end of the remote cannot be distinguished from the other end and people usually end up holding it the wrong way.

Existing hacks: 

Some people put an asparagus rubber band around the bottom half so they know which end to pick.

These are some of the ideas we came up with:

1. Have a different texture on both ends  - matte and gloss
2. Make one end a little heavier so that it is easier to pick up and you know which end it is
3. Move the buttons to one end of the remote.
4. Have a bump on one end or a raised logo kinda thing
