## Reading Assignment 8: Visual Design


Chapter 4, Organization and Visual Structure, from Mullet and Sano:

The idea that stood out to me most was the concept of negative or white space in design. I knew that having white space may increase readability but never realized the
significance behind it. The true essence of having white space is to shift the readers attention to the more important regions in the display.
For instance, white spaces can be used on side of a page, thereby giving the illusion of a vertical axis, which isolates and emphaiszes
the text to the right of it. It also contrasts different categories of items based on their spatial location.

Chapter 6, Arranging Elements, from Duarte’s slides:

I'm familiar with the idea of using contrast when you're presenting something, cuz its easier for the viewers to grasp the difference
immediately or know which part is more important. That applies to text. 
But I never paid attention to the order of the flow when you are presenting a chart or a process or anything that has a diagram on it.
True, it could get confusing if the viewers don't know in which direction they should be reading it. Are they supposed to read it horizontally, or vertically?
Its interesting to know that even without using arrows, it is possible to present the correct order of flow in a diagram. I liked the tips
provided in the chapter on how to develop flows in your presentation, which will convey the intended order to the user reading the slide.

Chapter 5 on preattentive visual processing from Colin Ware’s book “Information Visualization: Perception for Design.”:

This chapter was the most interesting so far. There is so much going on with the human eye vision. It not only picks the visual information
but also retunes every part of the visual brain to resolve the query task. It considers a number of features based on form, color, motion
and spatial position. Similary, while designing something, we need to be able to map these visual attributes and figure out the approximate quantities for each. Other important factors that contribute to
visual search are field of view, tunnel vision, role of motion in attracting attention. This looks like a multivariate analysis and will certainly pose challenges while making design decisions!
