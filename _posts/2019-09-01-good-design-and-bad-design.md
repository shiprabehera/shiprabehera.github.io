We had a short class-discussion about everyday objects and classifying them under good design and bad design. I brainstormed some of these ideas with my friend Telly and we came up with these examples.

**Bad Design**

1. A lot of brands package shampoo and conditioner in exact same bottles! As a person who needs glasses, I find it annoying not to be able to distinguish between them in the shower. The bottles should be of different shapes or colors so that I do not have to read it out everytime before using it.

2. USB connectors - I cannot count the number of times I have plugged it in the wrong way. This is not a huge problem because if you plug it in the wrong way, it just doesn't go in. But still, I find myself and others doing this a lot of time, even though we know what is the problem.

3. Japanese websites - They suck. Period. Just head over to this link to their [most popular e-commerce site](https://www.rakuten.co.jp/). They are cluttered and crammed with texts and icons and links. When I was living there and had to navigate my finances on their bank/credit card website, it would be a nightmare because literally ALL of my details would be on one page, with tons of other links scattered around.

**Good design**

1. Google search bar - just a search bar on a screen. Its convenient and is essentially what Google is all about. Just click and start typing.

2. Apple pay - I use it everywhere I can. I barely carry my wallet ever since I started using it. I can flick between multiple cards. I like that I donâ€™t have to fumble with my wallet and change, thus saving time.

3. Height adjustable desks - I used to have this in my previous workplace and I was amazed by the convenience it provides. You just push a button and now you can work while standing! Its also a great option for people with different heights as you can easily customize the height according to your posture.

4. Prepaid cards - Japan has this system of prepaid cards called Paso or Suica which can be used for almost anything - local trains, buses, metro, vending machines, convenience stores, parking, laundry, coin lockers and much more.

This exercise taught us to observe and notice how we interact with the objects in our environment and how do we arrive at judgements regarding their ease of use. We also realized that everything designed has some explicit criteria, but _is it usable_, and _is it usable to people_ are the key questions. Understanding some of the influencing factors which go behind a design would be a key part of this course.
