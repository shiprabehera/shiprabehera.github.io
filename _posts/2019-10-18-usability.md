## Reading Assignment 7: Usability

Gulf of execution - difference between the intentions of the users and what the system allows them to do or how well the system supports those actions. 

Gulf of evaluation - difficulty of assessing the state of the system and how well the artifact supports the discovery and interpretation of that state.

Example of everyday task which is affected by gulf of execution and gulf of evaluation:
A washing machine

Gulf of execution problem:

I want to wash clothes but there are a lot of steps involved!

Add clothes, select load, select water temperature, select wash cycle, select fabric type, add coins, add detergent, 
and finally add to dryer. 
Too many options confuse and distract the user.

Gulf of evalaution problem:

Some washing machines do not indicate how much longer they'll take to finish washing, or what stage it is at. 

Some of Nielsen's heuristics which fail for the washing machine are:

1. Visibility of system status

2. Match between system and real world

3. Consistency and standards

4. Flexibility and efficiency of use 

5. Aesthetic and minimalistic design
