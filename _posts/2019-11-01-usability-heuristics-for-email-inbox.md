I thought of some usability heuristics for email inbox:

1. Visibility of system status: User should know the status of the mail sent. Gmail gives feedback.

2. User control and freedoml: User should be able to logout by clicking one button. Currently, in gmail, the user needs to click on the account first and has to sign out from all accounts.

3. Recognition rather than recall: User should be able to easily identify between read and unread messages.

4. Consistency and standards: User should be able to identify important or priority marked emails because of the icons used. Gmail uses star icon to indicate them.

5. Flexibility and efficiency of use: User should be able to reply and compose messages quickly via shortcuts.

6. Match between system and real world: When searching for a message, user should be able to check where they are searching in - inbox, sent, important, etc. Gmail shows this in the search box.
