title: About me
---

Hey there! I'm Shipra Behera. I go by the pronouns She and Her. 

I'm a second year Masters student in the department of Computer Science, in the University of Colorado, Boulder. At CU, I worked with Professor Eric Rozner last semester on computer vision applications in edge computing environments. I'm also a Teaching Assistant this semester for the course CSCI 1300: Starting Computing.

I have worked as a software engineer for four years. I'm interested in distributed systems, site reliability engineering and software architecture in general. When I have time, I also like contributing to open source projects  :)

I like [reading novels](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/54036489), [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWTtTyjgd08yp), [travelling, hiking and taking lots of pictures](https://www.instagram.com/ships_shipra/)!

_Fun facts about me:_

 - I can speak 5 languages (more or less!)

 - I watched the sunrise from the highest point in the land of the rising sun ;)
