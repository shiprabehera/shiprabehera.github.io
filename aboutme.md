title: About me

Hey there! I'm Shipra Behera. I'm a second year Masters student in the department of Computer Science, in the University of Colorado, Boulder. I'm interested in distributed sytems, site reliability engineering and software architecture in general. At CU, I worked with Professor Eric Rozner last semester on my independent study. 

I like music, travelling, hiking and taking lots of pictures!
