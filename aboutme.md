title: About me
---

Hey there! I'm Shipra Behera. I'm a second year Masters student in the department of Computer Science, in the University of Colorado, Boulder. I'm interested in distributed sytems, site reliability engineering and software architecture in general. At CU, I worked with Professor Eric Rozner last semester on computer vision applications in edge computing environments. I'm also a Teaching Assistant this semester for the course CSCI 1300: Starting Computing.

I like reading [novels](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/54036489), music, travelling, hiking and taking lots of pictures!
